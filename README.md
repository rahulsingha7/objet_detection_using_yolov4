# Object Detection Using YOLOv4

## Overview

This project focuses on object detection using the YOLOv4 architecture. We created and annotated our own dataset, applied YOLOv4, and used pretrained weights for model initialization. The trained model is capable of accurately identifying objects in images.

## Methodology

### 1. Dataset Creation and Annotation

- **Dataset**: Created and annotated for specific object detection tasks.

### 2. YOLOv4

- **YOLOv4**: The fourth iteration of the "You Only Look Once" series, YOLOv4 provides state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection. It is known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for applications requiring quick and precise object identification.

### 3. Model Training

- **Pretrained Weights**: Utilized pretrained weights to accelerate the training process and enhance model performance.
  
- **Training Process**: The model was trained on the custom dataset, refining feature learning and boosting detection accuracy.

### 4. Object Detection

The trained YOLOv4 model is deployed to identify and classify objects within images, demonstrating robust performance and precision.

## Results

- **Object Detection**: The YOLOv4 model effectively detects and identifies objects, providing high accuracy and reliability.
